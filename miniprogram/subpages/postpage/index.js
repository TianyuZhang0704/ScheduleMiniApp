    content: "Took csc108 in Fall 2020 and it was my lowest mark in all of my courses. It was my first ever programming course and I really struggled (procrastinating on assignments were some factors why I did bad). I wanna try and do a cs minor and I was wondering if itâ€™s worth it to retake csc108 to improve my understanding (Retaking could also boost up my cgpa - from 3.6ish to 3.7ish).",
